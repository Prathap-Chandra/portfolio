# Linear Regression

Linear regression is one of the simplest and most widely used statistical techniques in machine learning. It models the relationship between a dependent variable $y$ and one or more independent variables $x$ by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

## Model

The linear regression model is:

$$y = w x + b$$

where $w$ is the weight (slope) and $b$ is the bias (intercept).

## Loss Function

The most common loss function for linear regression is the Mean Squared Error (MSE):

$$MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$$

## Applications

- Predicting house prices
- Forecasting sales
- Risk assessment
