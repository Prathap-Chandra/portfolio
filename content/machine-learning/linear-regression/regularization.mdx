# Regularization in Machine Learning

Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models by adding a penalty to the loss function.

## Types of Regularization

### L1 Regularization (Lasso)

Adds the sum of the absolute values of the weights to the loss function:

$$L = MSE + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^n |w_j|$$

### L2 Regularization (Ridge)

Adds the sum of the squared values of the weights to the loss function:

$$L = MSE + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^n w_j^2$$

## Why Use Regularization?

- Reduces model complexity
- Improves generalization
- Helps with feature selection (L1)
